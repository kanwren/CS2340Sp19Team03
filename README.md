# RISK Team 3

A recreation of the strategy board game RISK.

## Running

There is a two step compilation process, one for the frontend UI that
bundles javascript written in React, and the other for the scala
backend and templating framework.

Install node modules:
```bash
npm install
```

And start the UI compilation (in development mode) by typing:
```bash
npm run watch
```

Then run the server by typing:

```bash
sbt run
```

Then visit [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

## Playing

To play the game, you need to open 3 different localhost tabs and input atleast
3 different names.
